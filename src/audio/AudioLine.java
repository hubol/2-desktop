/**
 * This class wraps a single SourceDataLine and continously feeds it with sound data in the form of bytes.
 * The AudioLine is a pure java software sample mixer which gets playback audio data from StupidClips.
 * The clips should always be given a reference to the AudioLine instance upon creation, as the classes are tightly bound.
 * 
 * A clip cannot be played on multiple AudioLines due to the na√Øve linked list implementation. 
 * This should however not be a problem. 
 * 
 * The AudioLine runs in a separate thread which continously fills a small buffer with a mix of whichever clips are
 * playing at the time.
 * 
 * Sound data is expected to be signed, little endian. However conversion from unsigned 8 bit takes place on the fly.
